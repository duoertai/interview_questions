use run length encoding to encode a string with any ascii character
not allowed to use delimiter

ans:
the only thing that we need to be concerned with is digits
since it makes it confusing to tell which part is run length and which part is char
digit could be 0-9, but the count of digit could be 1-infinity
we can put a length of run length before run length and use a 0 to separate for example
1111111111222233
1201021043102
